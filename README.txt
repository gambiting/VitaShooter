Shoot4Fun: Revitalized

This is the game I made for my project. It was made using the Playstation Mobile SDK, so it should run on any Playstation Mobile - compatible device: that includes phones and tablets, but most importantly - the Playstation Vita, the Sony's Flagship portable gaming console.
Developing for this device was an interesting experience, mostly because the SDK has only been released a few months ago, so there is little support and many bugs in the software. However, the platform seems to have solid foundations and was a pleasure to use(when it worked).
This game a top-down arcade shooter, making a great use of Playstation Vita's dual analog sticks - the left one can be used for  moving our character, while the right one can be used for aiming. This game aims to be fast and intense, so there can be plenty of enemies and bullets on the screen - which turned up to be a problem at one stage of the project. Mobile devices are still not capable enough to support brute force approach to problems like collision detection and path finding - and therefore, more elegant solutions needed to be found . I have implemented a QuadTree structure in my progam,which allowed me to greately increase the frame rate. When I was doing collision detection of all enemies with each other, I could only get 25fps with 50 enemies. After implementing Quad Trees, that number went up to 40fps. For most of the time,the program is running above 30fps and this is what I have aimed for.
As for future work, I would like to take on this project and develop a fully finished game that would be worthy of a release on the Playstation Store.
